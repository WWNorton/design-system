A component describes a common pattern that can be composed together with other components and content to create larger things like pages or applications. In order to facilitate composition, components seek to do one thing well and be as simple as possible while still providing options for customization. TK Badge A badge brings attention to information about a related component. Button A button allows the user to perform an action. TK Callout A callout brings attention to related but non-essential information. Checkbox A checkbox allows the user to check or uncheck an option. TK Choice Field A choice field allows the user to choose one or more option from a set of related options. Disclosure A disclosure allows the user to show and hide additional content. TK Dropdown A dropdown allows the user to select an option from a list of options in an expandable overlay. TK Link A link allows the user to navigate to another place. TK Modal A modal presents important information or simple tasks to the user in an overlay. TK Popover A popover allows the user to reveal more information or non-critical tasks in an overlay.

Chunk content into meaningful groups of information.Think about chunking like an outline. Why: Purposeful chunking helps people understand the content because each chunk has a specific goal. It also makes it easier for people to skim the text for what they need, which is how people read digital copy. Use short paragraphs# Use short paragraphs with white space between them instead of long paragraphs that become walls of text. Why: Walls of text are more difficult for people to comprehend. They can seem intimidating and time-consuming, which means people are more likely to skip them or even close the page or application completely. Use lists# Use a list when you have three or more related items.Don't include more than seven items in your list if users need to remember each item. Why: Lists structure content and break information into manageable pieces, which helps comprehension, but using lists doesn't mean we should include dozens of items. Short-term memory is limited. Seven items is typically considered the maximum a person can hold in their head at one time. Format data# Don't use long strings of numbers or data, like 2123545500 or CCTACAGGAT.Chunk data with standard formatting and expected symbols, like (212) 354-5500.Add white space for long strings of letters or numbers, like CCT ACA GGAT. Why: Formatting data helps to minimize user error and makes it easier for people to scan.

Why: Headings should help people understand the content's structure and support your chunking (see section above). People who use screen readers often use headings to navigate. Headings makes it easier for them to navigate, find what they're looking for and complete activities. Be concise# Don't use long sentences as headings.Use short phrases or a single word. Why: Headings should provide a brief overview of the content and be easily scannable. Be specific# Don't be general, vague, or use words that don't relate to the content being structured.Be specific, so the heading provides a clear outline of the content. Why: Headings should be specific so users can quickly skim for the content they need. If headings are too general, it will be difficult for people to understand the content's structure and find the information they're looking for. Be unique# Always use unique headings.Never use the same heading twice on the same page. Why: Unique headings help people find their place. They are particularly important for screen reader users who often navigate and skim the text by heading. Convey rank# Don't skip headings (don't jump from a heading 1 to a heading 3).Use consecutive headings (heading 1 to heading 2, heading 2 to heading 3) Why: Screen reader users often use headings to navigate content. If we skip headings, these users might be confused or think that they are missing content.

Using clear words helps people understand and remember content and learning objectives. Clear words are beneficial for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, language impairments, memory impairments, and autism. Clear words also benefit people who are tired, distracted, or stressed, people with low literacy, and people who are working outside their first language, such as those who speak English as a second language or use sign language. "},{"title":"Clear words best practices","type":1,"pageTitle":"Usable Writing Guidelines","url":"docs/content/usable-writing-guidelines#clear-words-best-practices","content":"Use common words# Don't use complex words and phrases.Use familiar, everyday words.Define uncommon words if you need to use them. Why: Even though we're making educational materials, there's no need to make them more complicated or high-level than they need to be. When we need to use uncommon or technical terms due to the subject matter, define them within the activity. Don't make people refer back to the textbook or Google for a definition, which takes them away from the product and off the path of accomplishing their goal. Use active voice# Don't use passive voice (a subject that is a recipient of a verb's action). Example:Use active language (a subject that acts on a verb). Example: Why: Passive voice makes your writing difficult to understand. Active voice is easier for everyone to understand, but it's especially beneficial for people with cognitive impairments and non-native English speakers. Avoid technical or wordy language# Use familiar words or vocabulary.Define technical terms the first time you use them (if the subject matter requires them). Why: Familiar, straightforward language will help people focus on their objective instead of trying to parse difficult words or sentences. We shouldn't assume that people are familiar with technical terms defined elsewhere. Avoid double negatives# Don't use double negatives in your writing. This includes No/not + negative adverb (hardly, scarcely)No/not + negative prefix (un-, mis-, in-, non-)No/not + word that has a negative meaning (absence, without, fail)No/not in a prompt + an answer choice with a negativeExceptions within an exception Use positive language.

"},{"title":"Clear comprehension best practices","type":1,"pageTitle":"Usable Writing Guidelines","url":"docs/content/usable-writing-guidelines#clear-comprehension-best-practices","content":"Use literal language# Don't use idioms (a phrase or expression with a figurative, non-literal meaning). Use literal language. Idioms: Wrap my head around it → understand. Right under your nose → it was obvious. Missed the boat → missed the opportunity. Why: Literal language is clearer and doesn't obscure meaning. Literal language is easier for people with cognitive impairments, autism, and those who are learning English as a second language, as well as those who are tired, distracted, or stressed. Check readability# Aim to write text at an 8th grade reading level or lower.Review your content with a readability checker, like the Hemingway Editor app. Why: A readability checker analyzes the length of your words and sentences to assign your content a grade level. This grade level corresponds to the years of formal education someone would need in order to read and understand the content easily. If we write at a grade level that is too high for our users, it will be difficult for them to understand and absorb the content. Writing at an 8th grade level or lower is ideal, even for college students and instructors, and helps us ensure our content is readable by a majority of people. Be concise# Don't use long sentences.Use short, direct sentences that get to the point quickly. Why: The longer the sentence, the more difficult it will be to understand. This is most impactful for people with cognitive impairments and non-native English speakers. Expand acronyms on first use# Avoid using acronyms whenever possible.Spell out uncommon acronyms on first use, if you need to use them. For example: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Once you've defined the acronym you can use the acronym on its own. Why: Expanding an acronym on first use helps people remember what the acronym stands for. It doesn't assume that they have memorized the acronym and it allows people to keep reading instead of returning to the textbook or Google to find it. Avoid abbreviations# Avoid abbreviations, especially when they could be confusing or have multiple meanings. For example, “Dr.” could mean “doctor” or “drive.” Write out all words when possible, unless the abbreviation is important for the subject matter. Why: Writing out all abbreviations makes the content more available to all people, but it's particularly helpful for those with cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, and autism. Write in sentence case# Don't write in all caps or title case.Write in sentence case: the first letter of a sentence is capitalized. Why: All caps and title case are more difficult to read, especially for people with dyslexia.

Make the relationship between labels and components clear# Don't separate labels from the components they're describing.Place the label in or close to the component. Why: Placing the label and component together helps to associate the label with the component. This is important for buttons, dropdowns, text boxes, and lists. It's particularly important to make sure labels and components stay together on small phone screen sizes as well. This spatial relationship on the screen is important for people with cognitive impairments and people who use screen magnifiers and voice recognition. This relationship is also essential for people who use screen readers, so it needs to be conveyed through the structure of the code as well. (Talk to the Accessibility team if you need more information.) Use device-agnostic instructions# Don't use verbs like tap, drag, type, press, or see.Use verbs like select, choose, add, or click. Why: Providing instructions for one specific device or experience excludes people who use assistive technology and people who are on devices that have different methods of interacting with content (for example, using a mouse vs a phone with a touch screen). If we limit our instructions, these people will assume that they cannot complete the action being described. Use action verbs for buttons# Don't use vague or generic button text (like “configure”).Use precise, task-focused verbs (like “save”). Why: Vague or generic labels can make people confused or uncertain about what will happen if they click a button. Specific action verbs help people remember what they should be doing but they are precise enough that people know what will happen before they click the button. Use meaningful link text# Don't use ambiguous link text, such as “click here” or “read more.”Write link text so that it describes the content of the link target.Ask: If the link were stand-alone text, would you understand where the link would take you? Why: When we include a link, we should help people understand where that link will take them before they click it.

This applies to both developers and designers who use the design system as well as customers who use products built with the design system.

Refer to the design token types inheritance outline for more clarification of this convention. @use '@wwnds/core'; // ✨ Best: modify a known role token at this scope and then use it// (not always possible).foo { --nds-background-color: var(--nds-base-color-20); background-color: var(--nds-background-color);} // 👍 Good: use the role token.foo { background-color: var(--nds-base-color-20);} // 👎 Bad: use the system token.foo { background-color: var(--nds-navy-20);} Copy Why? System token values are static and cannot be modified, which prevents you from using them to theme your component. "},{"title":"Override token values instead of property values whenever possible","type":1,"pageTitle":"Writing CSS","url":"docs/guides/dev/writing-css#override-token-values-instead-of-property-values-whenever-possible","content":"Some tokens, like text-color and background-color are set globally and are designed to use the CSS cascade to style all elements. We encourage you to embrace the cascade—a fundamental feature of CSS—modifying token values at specific scopes to accomplish your goals instead of modifying properties directly. @use '@wwnds/core'; // 👍 Good: override the token value and then use it.foo { --nds-text-color: var(--nds-base-color-10); --nds-background-color: var(--nds-primary-color-80); color: var(--nds-text-color); background-color: var(--nds-background-color);} // Okay: override the property value.foo { color: var(--nds-base-color-10); background-color: var(--nds-primary-color-80);} Copy Why? This will ensure that children of this component that use the role tokens use the locally-scoped values instead of the global ones. For instance, the focus-halo uses --nds-background-color to create the illusion of an offset halo when an element is focused. If your element's background color is hard-coded as --nds-primary-color-80, that focus halo will now have an offset that does not appear to match the background color. It's considered okay to use tokens directly in scenarios where component isolation is favored.
