## Accessibility first

**Accessibility should drive decisions and should never be an afterthought**. We
believe that focusing on accessibility at the outset improves usability for everyone.

<Callout title="Tips" border="left">

This is similar to the principle of mobile-first design, where designing first for
the constraints of a smaller screen ensures that users won't lose information when
using mobile devices.

- Define component boundaries based on information architecture and interaction
  design, not visual design. Everyone should be able to interact with the component
  and view its content, but not everyone has access to the visuals.
- Design for keyboard _before_ designing for mouse. Because keyboard flow is linear,
  designing for it first will force you to think about the linear layout before the
  non-linear experience of mouse users.
- **Developers**: [use ARIA sparingly and carefully](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#no_aria_better_bad_aria),
  but treat ARIA attributes as your source of truth for everyone whenever possible.

## Don't overwhelm

**Users should never feel distracted or overwhelmed**. This applies to both
developers and designers who use the design system as well as customers who use
products built with the design system.

<Callout title="Tips" border="left">

- Favor [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
  whenever possible and sensible defaults when many options are required.
- Use [progressive disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure)
  to allow for complexity without overwhelming.
- Avoid extraneous cognitive load&mdash;the user should be challenged by challenging
  content, not a challenging interface.
- **Developers**: be wary of abstractions that reduce code readability and maintainability.
