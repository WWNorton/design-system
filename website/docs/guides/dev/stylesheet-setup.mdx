All styling in the Norton Design System is done directly in CSS using the [Sass modules](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched) exposed by the `@wwnds/core` library.
This library can be used either as one [single global stylesheet](#single-stylesheet) for your entire application or as the basis for [a modular approach](#modular-usage).
Both approaches are covered here.

:::note Sass compiler
The Norton Design System's stylesheets must be compiled with the [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) Node module and will not work with [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).
This is because node-sass's underlying implementation, [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) does not support Sass modules and [has in fact been deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) in favor of [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) (sass's underlying implementation).

If your project is currently using node-sass, migrating should be as simple as swapping out node-sass for sass. View [the "How do I migrate?" guide](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate) for more details.

## Single stylesheet

The simplest way to use the design system's styling is to use a single global stylesheet.
This can be accomplished with either the pre-built CSS or the full Sass entry point.

### Pre-built CSS

Two CSS files are included in our release distributions of `@wwnds/core`.

- `dist/main.css` - the complete stylesheet.
- `dist/tokens.css` - only the global design tokens (excluding component tokens), set on the `:root` element.

```html
<!-- in a Node.js project -->
<link href="node_modules/@wwnds/core/dist/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- using unpkg as a CDN (not suitable for production but ideal for prototyping) -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/@wwnds/core/dist/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Custom build

If you would like to customize something but still use the complete stylesheet, it is recommended that you use the full Sass entry point.
For instance, the following will be identical to the `dist/main.css` file but with the primary color family assigned to yellow (default is teal).

```scss
@use '@wwnds/core/full' with (
	$primary-family: 'yellow',
);
```

Note that a similar approach can be accomplished by using [the `complete` mixin](core-api#complete) to create your own complete stylesheet.

## Modular usage

Using the Sass modules directly is ideal for scenarios where a single global stylesheet is not desired, such as in a React environment or when you only want to use part of the design system.

### Configuration

The best way to get started with modular stylesheets is to `@forward` a configured version of the design system for use in your stylesheets.
This acts as the main place where Sass variables are configured to meet the needs of your application's look and feel and does not itself contain any declarations.

```scss title="src/styles/_nds.scss"
// note: name this file whatever makes sense to you

@forward '@wwnds/core' with (
	$font-family-base: 'My fancy font',
	$radius-base: var(--nds-radius-xl),
	$primary-family: 'cyan',
);
```

:::success Customizable variables
Any variable in `@wwnds/core` that contains the `!default` flag is customizable in this way.

These variables are documented in <a href={useBaseUrl('sassdoc')} target='\_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>the Sassdoc documentation</a>, as well as [the Core API - Theming variables](core-api#theming-variables) table.
:::

Once your configured version of `@wwnds/core` has been forwarded, it should be `@used` anywhere you need to use the core mixins or functions.

### Setting tokens

At a minimum, you must create and use one global stylesheet to [set the design tokens](core-api#tokens) as CSS custom properties.
This is because every component, utility, and helper in the design system uses our [design tokens](/docs/foundations/design-tokens).

```scss title="src/styles/globals.scss"
@use 'nds'; // the configured & forwarded src/styles/_nds.scss

@include nds.tokens; // contains `:root` declarations with CSS custom properties

// optionally include other globals, such as the HTML reset styles
@include nds.reset;
```

### Other approaches

Other approaches, such as using the `@import` syntax or CSS-in-JS may work but aren't well-tested.
Use them at your own risk.

#### CSS modules

While not well tested, [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) can be composed with core styles in environments that support CSS modules, such as in React.

```scss title="src/components/CustomButton/nds-button.scss"
@use '../../styles/nds';

// apply the default design system styles for the button component
@include nds.button-style;
```

```scss title="src/components/CustomButton/index.module.scss"
@use '../../styles/nds'; // the configured & forwarded src/styles/_nds.scss

.btn {
	// override a component token
	--nds-button-border-radius: var(--nds-radius-pill);

	// set additional styles with core
	margin-bottom: nds.spacer("1rem");
}
```

```jsx title="src/components/CustomButton/index.jsx"
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@wwnds/react";
// main design system button styles
import "./nds-button.scss";
// modular styles
import styles from "./index.module.scss";

export const CustomButton = ({ children, ...props }) => (
	<Button className={styles.btn} {...props}>
		{children}
	</Button>
);
```
