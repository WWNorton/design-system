The implementation of the Norton Design System for the web is composed of two main packages:

- A modular [CSS library](#core-package) to help you style your application and content.
- A [React component library](#react-package) to help you compose accessible, robust applications and content.

These two libraries do not depend on each other but work best when used together.
Each is published to the public NPM registry under [the `@wwnds` scope](https://www.npmjs.com/org/wwnds).

:::note Audience
This guide is intended for developers and a minimal understanding of web technologies such as CSS and HTML is assumed.
Guidance on using the React library also requires a basic understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/).
:::

## Core package

The core package is a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) implementation of the [foundations](/docs/foundations) and styling for all [components](/docs/components).
It includes the following features:

- An implementation of the [design tokens](/docs/foundations/design-tokens) for all foundational elements (color, typography, etc.) set as [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*).
- Modular styling for all components via [Sass mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin).
- A global reset stylesheet, forked from [the Bootstrap reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/) to use the Norton Design System foundations.
- A Sass API for theming and customizing every aspect of the library, built on [Sass modules](https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched).

## React package

The React package is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) implementation of the components with no styling applied.
It includes the following features:

- A React [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) implementation of the Norton Design System [components](/docs/components).
- A rich developer experience powered by the comprehensive typings and descriptions for all top-level components and their props.
- Useful [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) to help you build stateless, functional applications.

## Independent package usage

Neither the [core package](#core) nor the [react package](#react) depend on one another and can therefore be used fully independently of each other.
For instance, you could use `@wwnds/core` to style a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) application, or you could apply your own styling to `@wwnds/react` without using anything from `@wwnds/core`.

However, this guide fill focus on combined usage, as the packages work best when used together.
