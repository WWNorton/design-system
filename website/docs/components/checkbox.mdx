> A checkbox allows the user to check or uncheck an option.

## Anatomy

The anatomy for both the standalone checkbox and a group of related checkboxes are outlined here.

### Checkbox

1. **Control** - the input control that conveys the current state of the checkbox to the user.
1. **Label** - a short name that lets the user know what the checkbox is checking. Clicking the label should toggle the checkbox.
1. **Description** (_optional_) - additional text that can be used to add clarity or context to the checkbox label. Clicking the description should do nothing.

### Checkbox Group

1. **Label** - text that conveys how the checkboxes are related and prompts the user to check one or more checkbox.
1. **Current selection**: a checked checkbox indicates that it will be included when the field is submitted.
1. **Choices** - the available checkboxes. Clicking a checkbox will check or uncheck it.

## Usage

- A single checkbox has two mutually exclusive states: checked or unchecked.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles the state of the checkbox.
- Use a group of checkboxes to allow a user to check zero, one or multiple options from a list, and display all available options.
- Checkboxes may allow users to sub-select options from a nested list (see tri-state checkboxes).
- Checkboxes work independently of other checkboxes, unless they are controlled by a tri-state checkbox.
- Avoid setting default options, because pre-checking an option makes it more likely that users will not make a conscious choice and submit an option unintentionally.
- Consider the most logical order to list options. Options may be listed alphabetically, by popularity, or some other ordered system that should be clear to the user.

:::tip Dos
- Do allow users to check an option by clicking the checkbox or its label.
- Do position the checkbox to the left of its label.
- Do separate groups of checkboxes with group labels.
- Do display options in a vertical layout for easier scanning.
- Do define a label for the checkbox, even if it is not visible (example: when checking a row in a table).
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don‚Äôt use checkboxes if only one item can be checked from a list. Use radio buttons or a dropdown instead.
- Don‚Äôt use a checkbox if an action will take immediate effect when the user checks or unchecks it. Add a Submit button to confirm, or use a toggle instead.
- Don‚Äôt use negative statements for a checkbox, because taking action to check it is confusing and counter-intuitive. (example: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to receive email‚Ä¶‚Äù)

### Tri-state Checkbox

A tri-state checkbox can be used to represent and control the state of a group of other checkboxes.
This type of checkbox adds an "indeterminate" state that conveys to the user that some&mdash;but not all&mdash;of the related checkboxes are checked.

- If all options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as checked.
- If some of the options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as indeterminate (partially checked).
- If none of the options in the group are checked, the tri-state checkbox displays as unchecked.
- If a user checks a tri-state checkbox, then all the options in the group are checked.
- If a user unchecks a tri-state checkbox, then all the options in the group are unchecked.

## React API

```js
import { Checkbox, CheckboxGroup } from '@wwnds/react';
```

### Checkbox

A single checkbox component.

```jsx live
<Checkbox
	description="Additional information about this checkbox."
	required
	requiredIndicator
>
	Checkbox
</Checkbox>
```

<PropsTable from={Checkbox} />

### CheckboxGroup

A container for a set of related `Checkbox` components and its associated prompt (`label`).

```jsx live
<CheckboxGroup label="Select your favorite fruits." name="fruit">
	<Checkbox thumbnail="üçé" description="A classic choice">Apple</Checkbox>
	<Checkbox thumbnail="üçå" description="A taste of the tropics">Banana</Checkbox>
	<Checkbox thumbnail="ü•ù" description="A bit more exotic">Kiwi</Checkbox>
	<Checkbox thumbnail="üçä" description="Tangy and juicy">Orange</Checkbox>
</CheckboxGroup>
```

<PropsTable from={CheckboxGroup} />
