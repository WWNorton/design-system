> A spinner lets the user know that something is processing or progressing.

## Anatomy

1. **Progress circle** - the circle spins to convey that something is processing and fills clockwise to convey progress toward completion.
1. **Label** - a description of what is processing or progressing.

## Usage

Spinners should appear on the screen when there is a processing delay of between 1-5 seconds.

<CalloutSuccess title="Do">

- Do use a spinner to communicate to the user that the screen is still loading but will be complete in a short time (5 seconds or less).
- Do use only 1 spinner on the screen at a time.
- If an application is loading, then the spinner will display and the user will be blocked from interacting with the application until it is loaded.
- For buttons with spinners, the button should always be disabled until the action completes and the spinner no longer displays on the button.

</CalloutSuccess>

<CalloutError title="Don't">

- Don’t use a spinner for an immediate process (less than 1 second); nothing should display in that situation.
- Don’t use a spinner if most of the application can load very quickly except for some text or data elements; use skeleton text loading indicator.
- Don’t use a spinner for a long process. If a process is expected to take more than 5 seconds to complete use a progress bar loading indicator.

</CalloutError>

<Callout title="Indeterminate vs. Determinate">

The spinner is said to be in "indeterminate" mode if it does not have a set value.
This conveys to users that something is processing without conveying how close to being done it is.

<div className="callout__example">
	<Spinner label="Loading..." />
</div>

When a spinner does have a set value, it is said to be in "determinate" mode.
This gives the user a better sense of how close it is to beng complete.

<div className="callout__example">
	<Spinner label="Downloading..." progress={0.35} />
</div>

</Callout>

## React API

We expose one component for the spinner API, the [Spinner](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/Spinner).

### Spinner

The `Spinner` component extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` interface.

```js
import { Spinner } from '@wwnds/react';
```

```tsx live
/* set progress to a value between 0 and 1 to make determinate */
<Spinner label="Loading..." progress={undefined} />
```

<PropsTable from={Spinner} />
