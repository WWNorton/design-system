> A spinner lets the user know that something is processing or progressing.

## Anatomy

1. **Progress circle** - the circle spins to convey that something is processing and fills clockwise to convey progress toward completion.
1. **Label** - a description of what is processing or progressing.

## Usage

- Use a spinner when there will be a delay of more than 1 second in loading or completing an action.
- A spinner can be used both when the amount of time is determined and when it is indeterminate.
- If an application is loading, then the spinner will display and the user will be blocked from interacting with the application until it is loaded.
- You can also use a progress bar.

:::tip Dos
- Do use only 1 spinner on the screen at a time.
- For buttons with spinners, the button should always be disabled until the action completes and the spinner no longer displays on the button.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use a spinner for an immediate process (less than 1 second); nothing should display in that situation.
- Don’t use a spinner if most of the application can load very quickly except for some text or data elements; use a skeleton instead.

### Indeterminate vs. Determinate

The spinner is in "indeterminate" mode if it does not have a set value.
This conveys to users that something is processing without communicating how close it is to being complete.

<div className="nds-example">
	<Spinner label="Loading..." />
</div>

When a spinner does have a set value, it is in "determinate" mode.
This gives the user an estimate of the percentage of time remaining until completion.

<div className="nds-example">
	<Spinner label="Downloading..." progress={0.35} />
</div>

## React API

We expose one component for the spinner API, the [Spinner](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/Spinner).

### Spinner

The `Spinner` component extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` interface.

```js
import { Spinner } from '@wwnds/react';
```

```tsx live
/* set progress to a value between 0 and 1 to make determinate */
<Spinner label="Loading..." progress={undefined} />
```

<PropsTable from={Spinner} />
