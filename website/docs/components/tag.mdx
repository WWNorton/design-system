> A tag allows the user to interact with or dismiss a status or classification.

## Anatomy

<img
	alt="A tag with indicators calling out the corresponding anatomy items of a gray tag container container a label of “tag label” followed by a dismiss indicator."
	src={useBaseUrl('/img/Anatomy_tag.png')}
/>

1. **Tag Container** - an outline or background sets the tag apart from adjacent text.
1. **Label** - the tag's label conveys a status or classification.
1. **Dismiss Indicator** - an icon that appears when the tag is dismissible.

## Usage

Use a tag to communicate status, denote active filter selection(s), or as a content tag.

- A tag may or may not be associated with another component.
When it is, it should be placed as close as possible to the component it is referencing.

:::tip Do
- Do use a tag if this component should be dismissible or if users need to select or interact with it for any reason.
:::

:::danger Don't
- Don’t use a tag to communicate a temporary or permanent state if users cannot interact with or dismiss it. Use a [badge](badge) instead.
:::

:::caution Caution
- In most contexts, a series of several tags can be overwhelming and create visual clutter. Use tags sparingly (1–3 tags) wherever possible.
- A tag should be styled with minimal padding around the text inside the container to distinguish it from a button.

## React API

We expose one component for the tag API, the [Tag](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/Tag).

### Tag

The `Tag` component extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` interface and renders either as a `<span>` or `<button>`, depending on its configuration.

- When `dismissible`, the tag will render as a `<span>` with a dismiss `<button>` inside of it.
- When the tag contains a link (`Link` or `a[href]`), it will render as a `<span>` to ensure that the link is clickable.
- The rest of the time, the tag will render as a `<button>` and can be reacted to by attaching an `onClick` callback.

```js
import { Tag } from '@wwnds/react';
```

```tsx live
<Tag>Norton Design System</Tag>
```

<PropsTable from={Tag} />
