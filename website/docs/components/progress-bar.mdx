> A progress bar lets the user know that something is processing or progressing.

## Anatomy

<img
	alt="A progress bar with indicators calling out the corresponding anatomy items of a gray track containing a teal progress indicator with a label: ‘Loading content…’ below the track."
	src={useBaseUrl('/img/Anatomy_progress-bar.png')}
/>

1. **Track** - a fixed width track for the progress indicator to travel along.
1. **Progress Indicator** - an animated bar that conveys processing or progress toward completion.
1. **Label** - a description of what is progressing.

## Usage

* Use a progress bar when there will be a delay of more than 1 second in loading or completing an action.
* A progress bar can be used both when the amount of time is determined and when it is indeterminate.
* If an application is loading, then the progress bar will display and the user will be blocked from interacting with the application until it is loaded.
* You can also use a spinner.

:::tip Do
- Do use only 1 progress bar on the screen at a time.
- Do start the progressive animation slower and allow it to move faster as it approaches the end. It is always a better user experience to exceed customer expectations.
:::

:::danger Don't
- Don't use a progress bar for an immediate process (less than 1 second). Nothing should display in that situation.
- Don't use a progress bar if most of the application can load very quickly except for some text or data elements. Use a skeleton instead.
- Don't use a progress bar inside of a button. Use a spinner or loading state instead.

### Indeterminate vs. Determinate

The progress bar is in "indeterminate" mode if it does not have a set value.
This conveys to users that something is processing without communicating how close it is to being complete.

<div className="nds-example">
	<ProgressBar label="Loading..." />
</div>

When a progress bar does have a set value, it is in "determinate" mode.
This gives the user an estimate of the percentage of time remaining until completion.

<div className="nds-example">
	<ProgressBar label="Downloading..." progress={0.35} />
</div>

## React API

We expose one component for the progress bar API, the [ProgressBar](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/ProgressBar).

### ProgressBar

The `ProgressBar` component extends the `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'div'>` interface.

```js
import { ProgressBar } from '@wwnds/react';
```

```tsx live
/* set progress to a value between 0 and 1 to make determinate */
<ProgressBar label="Loading..." progress={undefined} />
```

<PropsTable from={ProgressBar} />
