> A switch allows the user to immediately turn an option on or off.

## Anatomy

<img
	alt="An active ‘on’ switch with indicators calling out the corresponding anatomy items starting with Label to the left of the switch, descriptive text located below, followed by the control to the right of label and descriptive text."
	src={useBaseUrl('/img/anatomy_switch.png')}
/>

1. **Label** - a short name that lets the user know what the switch will turn on or off.
1. **Description** (_optional_) - a description that can be used to add clarity to the role of the switch.
1. **Control** - an indicator that lets the user know the current state of the switch.

## Usage

- When a user toggles a switch, its corresponding action takes effect right away.
- A switch has two mutually exclusive states&mdash;on and off.

:::tip Do
- Do use a switch to mimic a physical on/off switch in the interface.
- Do allow users to select the switch by clicking the control or its text label.
- Do choose a text label that clearly defines which UI element the switch controls. A tooltip or title attribute may be added to convey the on/off state.
:::

:::danger Don't
- Don’t use a switch if the option is part of a larger flow, with a final confirmation step or Submit button. Use a [checkbox](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use a switch if users can select multiple options from a list. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
