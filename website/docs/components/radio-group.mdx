> A radio group allows the user to select one option from a set of related options.

## Anatomy

The anatomy for both a group of related radio buttons and a single radio button are outlined here.

### Radio Group

1. **Label** - text that conveys how the radio buttons are related and prompts the user to select a single radio button.
1. **Current selection**: a selected radio button indicates that it will be the option that is submitted.
1. **Choices** - the available radio buttons. Clicking or arrowing to an unselected radio button will deselect the currently selected radio button.

### Radio Button

1. **Control** - the input control that conveys the current state of the radio button to the user.
1. **Label** - a short name that lets the user know what the radio button is selecting. Clicking the label should select the radio button.
1. **Description** (_optional_) - additional text that can be used to add clarity or context to the radio button label. Clicking the description should do nothing.

:::caution Single radio button usage
Radio buttons must always be part of a radio group.
Using a single radio button by itself would allow the user to check the option but not uncheck it.
If that is desired, use a [checkbox](checkbox) instead to ensure that the user can uncheck it.
:::

## Usage

- Use radio buttons to allow a user to select exactly one item from a set of options, and display all available options.
- Radio buttons should have between 2-5 options.
    - If you have more than 5 options, use a [dropdown](dropdown) or combo box.
- The options in a group of radio buttons must be mutually exclusive. The user can only select 1 Radio.
- Only use radio buttons when the field is required. If all radio buttons are in an unselected state on load, a user must select one of the radio buttons before proceeding.
- Arrow keys move focus within the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button.
- <kbd>Space</kbd> selects the focused radio button if it is not already selected.

:::tip Dos
- Do allow users to select a Radio by clicking the radio button or its text label.
- Do position the radio button to the left of its label.
- Do display options in a vertical layout, by default, for easier scanning.
- Consider the most logical order to display options, such as alphabetical, chronological or by popularity.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Don’t use radio buttons if a user could select multiple options. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don't use radio buttons if a user could select NO Radio. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use radio buttons if an action will take immediate effect when the user selects or deselects it.
    - Use a [switch](switch) if there are two opposite options (example: YES/NO, ON/OFF).
    - Otherwise, use a group of regular [buttons](button).

## React API

```js
import { Radio, RadioGroup } from '@wwnds/react';
```

### RadioGroup

```jsx live
<RadioGroup label="Select your favorite fruit." name="fruit">
	<Radio thumbnail="🍎" description="A classic choice">Apple</Radio>
	<Radio thumbnail="🍌" description="A taste of the tropics">Banana</Radio>
	<Radio thumbnail="🥝" description="A bit more exotic">Kiwi</Radio>
	<Radio thumbnail="🍊" description="Tangy and juicy">Orange</Radio>
</RadioGroup>
```

<PropsTable from={RadioGroup} />

### Radio

Note: there is no scenario where you would use a single `Radio` alone.

```jsx live
<Radio>Apple</Radio>
```

<PropsTable from={Radio} />
