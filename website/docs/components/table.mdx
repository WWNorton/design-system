> A table allows users to view data organized in rows and columns.

## Anatomy

Tables contain **cells** of data arranged in a grid.

1. **Header row** - the first row of a table contains cells that act as labels for the columns.
	 - **Sort indicator** (_required when sortable_) - sortable header cells must convey their current sort state, which can be ascending, descending, or unsorted.
1. **Rows** - a horizontal slice of the table groups related cells.
1. **Columns** - a vertical slice of the table groups cells related by the label in the header cell.

## Usage

Use a table to organize and display long lists of data or content, or to help users find a specific piece of information in a large data set.

- Columns should be in a logical order from left to right based on the content. The farthest left content column should meaningfully label the row. For example, in a student set the first column should be the student's name.
- Search and filters can be used in conjunction with tables to help users find information
- Table content can include:
  - Text
  - Numbers
  - Checkboxes or radio buttons
  - Custom content, such as buttons
- Checkboxes or radio buttons should be the farthest left column. They're used to take bulk actions on the selected items in a table.
- Tables must have at least 2 columns.
- Column titles in the header row should be as short as possible but can wrap to 2 rows and then truncate if necessary.
- Table content should ideally fit on one row but may wrap to multiple lines.
- The data within the table should be related in a meaningful way.
- Column titles should accurately label the data within the column, and include units of measurement in the column title if applicable.
- All content within a column is the same level of hierarchy as all other content within that column. A table shouldn't be used to communicate hierarchy.
- If a table has no content, it should display an empty state or not display the table at all.
- Use an alternating striped background for tables with a lot of complex data to help users keep track of the rows.

### Dos and Don'ts

<CalloutSuccess title="Dos">

Do always include a header row that clearly labels each column.

</CalloutSuccess>

<CalloutError title="Don'ts">

Don't use a table purely for layout purposes.
