## Anatomy

The Multiple Choice pattern contains two views that are presented sequentially in the user flow:

1. A [question](#question) view, where the user responds to a prompt by selecting an answer and then submitting it.
	Submitting a response immediately opens the feedback view.
2. A [feedback](#feedback) view, where the user learns whether they answered correctly and is presented with additional feedback about their answer.
	Closing the feedback returns the user to the response view.

### Question

The question view presents a prompt to the user, allowing them to select and then submit their answer.
Once submitted, the [feedback](#feedback) view appears.

![The question anatomy shows various elements, annotated with numbers that correspond to the following anatomy description.](/img/mc_anatomy_question.png)

1. **Question Framing** (_optional_) - introductory content that provides additional context for the question.
	This can include any type of content, including but not limited to text, images, and video.
1. **Question Stem** - the text-only prompt. Answer choices are responses to the question stem.
1. **Functional Instructions** (_optional_) - the constraints for answering the question.
	Unlike the stem and framing, this should not contain subject matter related to the question.
1. **Answer Choice** - an option that answers the question.
	1. **Selector** - a [radio button](/docs/components/radio-group) that indicates which choice is currently selected and will be submitted.
	1. **Identifier** - a letter or number that identifies the choice.
	1. **Response** - an answer that relates directly to the question stem.
	1. **Response Indicator** (_only visible after submission_) - a label that signifies whether a submitted response was correct or incorrect.
		Once visible, the answer choice can no longer be selected.
1. **Submit Button** - a [button](/docs/components/button) that submits the chosen answer.

### Feedback

Feedback is presented in a [modal dialog](/docs/components/modal) after the user has submitted an answer.
Once closed, the user should be returned to the [question](#question) view.

![The feedback anatomy shows a modal dialog, annotated with numbers that correspond to the following anatomy description.](/img/mc_anatomy_feedback.png)

1. **Title** - the title should summarize the result of the user's submission in as few words as possible.
1. **General Feedback** - the answer that the user submitted and whether it is correct or incorrect.
1. **Supplementary Feedback** (_optional_) - additional answer-specific content.

## Design Guidelines

Following these guidelines will help us create a more consistent experience of multiple choice questions throughout Norton products.

### Display the stem and answer choices in the same view

The question stem and its corresponding answer choices should be viewable together, rather than presenting them in separate views or requiring the user to scroll to view them together.

{/* TODO: add image */}

:::note Why?
Multiple choice requires the user to hold the question stem in their working memory in order to choose a corresponding response.
This can be difficult for us when we experience impairment of our working memory, such as when we're tired or if we've had a traumatic brain injury.
Displaying the responses in a different view from the question stem unnecessarily compounds this cognitive task.
:::

### Provide no more than 5 answer choices

We've chosen 5 as the Norton Design System's preferred limit for most cases, but this depends heavily on the amount of information in the stem and answer choices.

{/* TODO: add image */}

:::note Why?
To answer a multiple choice question, we must hold the question stem and all of the answer choices in our working memory.
The more answer choices there are, the more difficult this becomes.

If we have a disability that impairs our working memory or are experiencing a temporary impairment of our working memory, this may prevent us from even being able to answer the question.

A complex question stem will contribute to this as well, which is why we also recommend [keeping the stem brief](#keep-the-stem-and-instructions-clear-and-brief).
:::

### Deliver answer feedback in its own view

When feedback is displayed directly in the question view, it's impossible to guarantee that the user will notice it or absorb it.
The Norton Design System has chosen to use our [modal](/docs/components/modal) for feedback in order to bring focus to it.

{/* TODO: add image */}

:::note Why?
Absorbing feedback on our answer choice is critical for an effective multiple choice question.
Displaying it in the question view makes this difficult in many ways.

- The question view is already visually and cognitively dense.
Adding feedback to this view can disorient, distract, and overwhelm users, preventing them from absorbing it or potentially missing it entirely.
- Modal dialogs are the ideal way to directly bring attention to feedback for everyone, including users of assistive technology.
:::

### Keep the stem and instructions clear and brief

Both the question stem and the functional instructions give question authors a space to outline requirements for answering the question.
These should follow the rule of [accurate, clear, brief (in that order)](/docs/guides/usable-writing-guidelines#accurate-clear-brief-in-that-order)

:::note Why?
Complex, unclear, or long text will add extraneous cognitive load to an already information-dense question.
We want users to spend their brain power answering the question.
:::

### Always use visible text for answer choice feedback

Avoid using icons or color alone to convey whether the response was correct or incorrect.
Text is the only way to guarantee that the meaning will be understood by all users.

This supports low-vision users, English language learners, and users with cognitive disabilities.

:::note Why?
Users who can't differentiate colors, such as colorblind users or those with visual impairments, won't know which color is correct or incorrect.
All users must have access to the same information.
:::

### Use a consistent answer choice identifier

The Norton Design System allows answer choice identifiers to be Roman numerals, numbers, or letters to suit the needs of the application.
Avoid mixing these across the same set of questions.

:::note Why?
A consistent way to reference responses across questions ensures that we don't have to mentally switch from a familiar pattern.
This is especially critical for users who experience difficulty with attention and working memory.

## React API

Our implementation includes components for the [Question view](#question) and the [Feedback view](#feedback), as well as a hook to help manage state across views.

The following code demonstrates one way to compose the components and hook together.
Head to the <a href={useBaseUrl('/storybook/?path=/docs/patterns-multiple-choice--docs')}>Multiple Choice Storybook</a> to view a live example.

```tsx
import {
	MultipleChoiceQuestion,
	MultipleChoiceFeedback,
	useMultipleChoice,
	Button,
} from "@wwnds/react";

export function MultipleChoice({ choices }: { choices: string[] }) {
	const { questionState, setStatus, modalState } = useMultipleChoice(choices);

	const handleSubmit = useCallback(
		(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
			event.preventDefault();
			// check if the user submitted the correct answer or not.
			// for instance, use setStatus("correct") if they got it right.
		},
		[setStatus, questionState.selected],
	);

	return (
		// note that the <form> and <Button> are not part of the Multiple Choice
		// pattern's public API but are used to handle choice submission.
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<MultipleChoiceQuestion
				framing="..."
				stem="..."
				{...questionState}
			/>
			<MultipleChoiceFeedback {...modalState} />
			<Button type="submit" variant="solid">
				Submit
			</Button>
		</form>
	);
}
```

### MultipleChoiceQuestion Component

The `MultipleChoiceQuestion` component is used to render the multiple choice question. It accepts the following props:

<PropsTable from={MultipleChoiceQuestion} />

### MultipleChoiceFeedback Component

The `MultipleChoiceFeedback` component extends our [Modal component](../components/modal) and inherits all of its props except the ones related to the title.

<PropsTable from={MultipleChoiceFeedback} />

### useMultipleChoice Hook

The `useMultipleChoice` hook is used to manage the state of the multiple choice question.
It accepts an array of answer choices and returns the state shared by the `FeedbackModal` and `MultipleChoice` components.
