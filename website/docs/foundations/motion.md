title: Motion
---

The Norton design system has fully implemented the [Material Design's motion system](https://material.io/design/motion)
and it is highly recommended that you reference Material's guidance when designing
for motion. All motion tokens and utilities are available in the `@wwnds/core` library.

[^1]: The `duration-scalar` token is not part of Material Design's motion system.

## Duration Scalar

We've introduced the `duration-scalar` token to help modify transition durations on the fly.
It is highly recommend that you use the `transition` Sass function in `@wwnds/core`
to set your transitions, as it will automatically multiply your duration by the
`duration-scalar` token.

```scss
@use '@wwnds/core' as nds;

.my-sidebar {
	/*
	 * Easing is omitted because the transition function uses
	 * var(--nds-easing-standard) by default.
	 */
	transition: nds.transition(transform, var(--nds-duration-close));
}

.my-sidebar.open {
	transition: nds.transition(transform, var(--nds-duration-open));
}
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to skip the `transition` function, you can multiply
your durations by the `duration-scalar` yourself.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```scss
@use '@wwnds/core' as nds;

.my-sidebar {
	transition:
		transform
		calc(var(--nds-duration-scalar) * var(--nds-duration-close))
		var(--nds-easing-standard);
}

.my-sidebar.open {
	transition:
		transform
		calc(var(--nds-duration-scalar) * var(--nds-duration-open))
		var(--nds-easing-standard);
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Reduced Motion

To ensure that [prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
is always followed, the `duration-scalar` value is automatically set to `0` when
the user prefers reduced motion. Manually setting a duration that isn't multiplied
by the `duration-scalar` token will result in that duration not being `0` when
the user prefers reduced motion.

If you'd like to set reduced motion manually, you can also do so with the
`.nds-reduced-motion` utility class or the `reduce-motion` Sass mixin.

```scss
@use '@wwnds/core/full' as nds;

.no-motion {
	@include nds.reduce-motion;
}
```

### Debugging motion

During development, it can be useful to slow down durations and easings to ensure
so that you can see the animations in greater detail.
Because the `duration-scalar` token is set as a CSS custom property, it can be used
to increase or decrease all motion speeds across your application.

To modify it during development, simply open your dev tools, click on the
`<html>` element, and change the value of the `--nds-duration-scalar` CSS custom
property to any number greater than `1` to slow down and less than `1` to speed up.
